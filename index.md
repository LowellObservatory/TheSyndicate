## Charter:
*This syndicate will be for the discussion and construction of instrument software for Lowell Observatory.
We will discuss requirements, design, implementation, standards, libraries, documentation, unit
tests, etc. for the ongoing effort to replace and update the software that runs the instruments at
the DCT, Mars hill science telescopes, and Anderson mesa telescopes.  GitHub will be used for project
management, issue tracking, bug reporting, and communications within the syndicate.*
