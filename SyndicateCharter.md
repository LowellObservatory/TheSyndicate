# Lowell Software Syndicate

## Charter:
<blockquote>
This group will be for the discussion and construction of instrument software for Lowell Observatory.
We will discuss requirements, design, implementation, standards, libraries, documentation, unit
tests, etc. for the ongoing effort to replace and update the software that runs the instruments at
the DCT, Mars hill science telescopes, and Anderson mesa telescopes.
</blockquote>

## Tasks:
* Develop ArcCam library, a Python interface to the ‘Astronomical Research Cameras’ controllers.
* Get everyone developing Python software on the same page as to standards, libraries, log file formats, etc.  Draw up a Software Standards document for Lowell.
* Develop the LOCUS software system, which consists of a number of modules such as LoFits, LoFocus, LoGuide, Deinterlace, etc.
* Develop the LOUI replacement using PyQt5.
* Develop standards for software backup using Git and GitHub.
* Construct an organized set of documentation for all things software at Lowell.
* Discuss/Implement a robust, easy to use, system for tracking and managing software issues/bugs.
* As new software is developed, the group will act as alpha testers and will provide suggestions and feedback to the rest of the group.
