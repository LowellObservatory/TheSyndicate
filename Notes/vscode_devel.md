0. Clone the initial repository.
    - In vscode, hit 'F1' or View -> Command Palette
        - Type 'git clone' and hit enter. It'll prompt you for the
          remote repository URL, so copy and paste in a github URL
          (e.g. https://github.com/LowellObservatory/ArcCon) and hit enter.
          It'll then prompt you for a local place on your computer where you
          want the repository to go; it will be a subdirectory of whatever
          directory you choose, with the name the same as the repository.
        - After it's done, it'll prompt you in the bottom whether you want
          to open the repository or not. Open it up!
1. Make a new branch of the repository, Ryan might call his RyansBranch.
    - Get back to that command palette from above and type 'git create branch'
      and hit enter.
2. Develop! Make changes, do whatever. Make a few commits.
    - On your first commit, make sure you push the changes to github.
