# Notes on the Structure of the Syndicate

1. We should have an “Organization Account” on GitHub that we all can use. We might need an administrator.
    * The GitHub account, “LowellObservatory”, is an “Organization Account”.
2. Migrate stuff stored in SubVersion to GitHub?
3. “Project Management” software or “Issue Tracking” software. Use something that coordinates with GitHub or continue with JIRA?
    * GitHub Issues?  (online)
    * JIRA?              (on Jumar, if not using JIRA, can we recover old contents from JIRA?)
4. Adopt standards for code, libraries, documentation, unit tests.  Lowell Observatory Standards Document. (on GitHub)
5. Make sure all contributing developers have the proper development environment installed on their computers. (Anaconda/Miniconda)
6. We can use GitHub Learning Lab (https://lab.github.com) to get everyone up to speed on GitHub.  We can put together an example project that everyone can contribute to and see how it works.  Perhaps we’ll do a few hands on presentations with GitHub so everyone know how to use the versioning system, the “Issues” feature, and the Wiki feature.
7. Where documents are found (by me) currently:
    * Google Docs (personal)
    * Confluence
    * Lowell Wiki
    * JIRA
    * GitHub
    * 10.10.100.15/internal/
8. We need to get everyone who will be participating up to speed on using GitHub.
    * GitHub accounts for all, talk about email messages from GitHub.
    * Add everyone to LowellObservatory organization, set their permissions.
    * Learn about structure of repositories.
    * Learn to checkout, branches, commit, pull request, merge, etc.
    * Learn to use Issues, including labels, milestones, assignment.
    * Construct a test/toy project to see how this all works.
